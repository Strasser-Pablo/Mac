Move Particle
=============


\defgroup GR_Move_Particle Move Particle
\ingroup GR_JetDEau

The class in this module calculate the move of particles with the velocity field.
The move of particle consist to solve the following ODE:
\f[\frac{d x}{d t}=v(x)\f]

Where \f$v(x)\f$ is the speed interpolated in the grid.
